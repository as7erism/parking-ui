# UC Parking Redesign

A redesign of the widely-panned University of Cincinnati parking pass management UI.

## Design

Our research began with employing Nielsen's 10 Principles to identify pain points of the original application.
Some issues we identified were the following:

1. Visibility of System Status

There are many notable pieces of information, like what dates passes become available, that are hidden in text-heavy boxes at the bottom of the home page.
We aimed to consolidate this information and make it more immediately accessible.

2. Match Between System and the Real World

There exists some strange use of vocabulary in the original UI.
For instance, the term "parking permit" is used throughout the application, despite "parking pass" being a more well-known term.

3. Recognition Rather than Recall

In the original UI, there is no indication for where lots are located on campus, which requires users to recall information they may have never seen before.
There is no provided method for locating lots in the original application.
We aimed to provide a means for users to easily locate their intended parking location.

4. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

The original UI contains an overabundance of buttons and options, many of which are redundant.
Its style is also unaligned with that of most official UC sites.
We aimed to unify the style with UC sites and consolidate the options.
